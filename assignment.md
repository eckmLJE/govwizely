# GovWizely Front End Engineer Assignment

We would like you to develop an app in React that renders objects from
HealthCare.gov API https://www.healthcare.gov/developers/).

When a user visits this app, they should see all the available content
types (objects, collections, and index) in a drop-down list. When they
select a content type, they should see a list of objects with the
title, URL and excerpt. When they click on the title, they should see
a separate page that renders all attributes of the object. When they
press back in the browser, they should see the list of objects they
previously selected.

Impress us with your UI skill and please include your automated tests.
The estimate completion times will vary based on experience level, but
time to completion is not a factor in our review process.

There is no deadline for this assignment, but this open position will
be filled once we have found the right candidate. If you decide to not
participate, please let me know for our own internal tracking
purposes.
